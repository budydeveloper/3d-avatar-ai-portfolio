-- letter of presentation --

I am a professional developer from Barcelona, Spain, with experience in the industry since 2018. 
My expertise lies in backend development, primarily focusing on Java. However, over the years, I 
have developed a passion for all aspects of software development, including cloud integration. I 
thoroughly enjoy engaging in each stage of the development process, from conceptualization 
to implementation. Creating new environments and actively participating in all facets of 
development brings me great satisfaction. My adaptability and enthusiasm enable me to 
provide a comprehensive and valuable perspective to every project. 
 
Additionally, I possess a keen interest in software architecture and AI, which motivated me to  
pursue a master's degree in these fields. 


-- extra non-curricularm information --

I worked in various sectors before fully dedicating myself to the tech industry. I was a house painter and an apprentice in home renovations, 
gaining manual skills like furniture assembly and electrical work. I also worked as a cook at McDonald's in a high-demand environment for over two years. 
Additionally, I held temporary roles as a warehouse assistant, cleaner, and waiter, both in Spain and Australia. 
I also coordinated events and worked as an Uber delivery driver, completing over 2,000 deliveries.

These jobs helped me develop skills such as responsibility, adaptability, and the ability to work under pressure, before focusing on my tech career.
