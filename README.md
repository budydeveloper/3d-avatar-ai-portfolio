# 🦑 3D Avatar AI Portfolio - Squid Game Style 🦑

Welcome to my 3D Avatar AI Portfolio project! This repository showcases a unique 3D avatar modeled after myself and styled with the iconic *Squid Game* theme. The project combines various state-of-the-art technologies such as 3D modeling, voice cloning, and language models to create an interactive and personalized experience. Let’s dive into the features and details! 🎮

## 📜 Project Description
This project consists of an interactive 3D avatar that replicates my appearance, voice, and professional knowledge. The goal is to build a digital portfolio that not only demonstrates my skills, but also provides an engaging way to interact with my professional background.

### 🎯 Main Features:
1. **3D Avatar** 🧍‍♂️:
   - The 3D avatar is created using a model based on my own appearance, customized with *Squid Game*-style outfits.
   - The avatar is interactive and can respond to various actions and inputs from the user.

2. **Voice Cloning** 🎤:
   - Integrated voice cloning using `Tortoise TTS` to create a lifelike replica of my voice.
   - The voice is used for answering questions, providing details about my career, and other interactions.

3. **AI-Powered Conversations** 🤖:
   - Utilizes `Llama 3.2`, a large language model, trained specifically with my CV and LinkedIn data.
   - The AI responds in English, providing accurate and relevant information about my work experience, education, and skills.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Three.js** for rendering the 3D avatar in a web environment.
- **React.js** and **Material-UI** for creating the web interface.
- **Tortoise TTS** for voice cloning.
- **Llama 3.2** for AI-based text generation and responses.
- **GLTFLoader** and **OrbitControls** for 3D model loading and interactions.
- **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS** for the overall web development.
